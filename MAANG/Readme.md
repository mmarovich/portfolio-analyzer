###in this file you fill find the Monte Carlo Simulation

##User Story: as a fintech student, I wanted to create a Monte Carlo Simulation so that i can show potential investors 
possible projected values of certain stocks. 

Acceptance Criteria: Given that I wanted to create a Monte Carlo simulation when i define the cumulative return, then the 
simulation should show which stock generates the most in each portfolio. or. .....then the simulation will generate the
projective profits for each portfolio.
